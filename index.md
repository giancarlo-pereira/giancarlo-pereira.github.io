# Welcome to my personal website!

My name is Giancarlo Pereira and I am currently a Computer Science PhD at NYU Tandon.

There, I work with Professors [Claudio Silva](https://ctsilva.github.io) and [Daniele Panozzo](https://cims.nyu.edu/gcl/daniele.html).

Previously, I was a Physics graduate student at Columbia University.

I received an M.A. in 2024.

During my time there, I worked with Professor [Abhay Pasupathy](https://anp-lab.physics.columbia.edu) in Cryogenic Atomic Force Microscopy.

In addition to research, I was awarded a [Lead Teaching Fellowship](https://ctl.columbia.edu/graduate-instructors/opportunities-for-graduate-students/lead-teaching-fellows/) in the 2023-2024 academic year and taught several laboratory courses.
