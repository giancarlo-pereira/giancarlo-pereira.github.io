I have been committed to education prior to starting college in the United States.
Back in my high school in Brazil, I worked as a tutor for exams such as the SAT, Physics AP, TOEFL, and scientific olympiads.
I have held a close belief that education can be transformative to one's personal and professional lives.

In college, I further deepened my commitments to improving as an instructor.
